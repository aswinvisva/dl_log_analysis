## Apache
Apache HTTP Server (https://httpd.apache.org) is one of the most popular web servers. Apache servers usually generate two types of logs: access logs and error logs. We provide an error log for the purpose of research on anomaly detection and diagnosis. The log file was collected from a Linux system running Apache Web server, as part of the *[Public Security Log Sharing Site](http://log-sharing.dreamhosters.com/)* project. If you are interested in Apache access logs, you may find them there. 

Note that `Apache_2k.log` is a sample log. The raw logs can be requested from Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1144100
