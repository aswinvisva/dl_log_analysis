## OpenStack

OpenStack (https://www.openstack.org) is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter. This dataset was generated on [CloudLab](https://cloudlab.us/), a flexible, scientific infrastructure for research on cloud computing. Both normal logs and abonormal cases with failure injection are provided, making the data amenable to anomaly detection research. You may find [more details of this dataset](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mind/papers/deeplog_misc.html) from the original paper:

Note that `OpenStack_2k.log` is a sample log. The raw logs can be requested from Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1144100
