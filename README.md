# Deep Learning Log Anomaly Detection

This project is to create deep learning models for log anomaly detection. The following are the results of deep learning models I implemented for this purpose,
tested on the HDFS dataset from LogHub:

self-supervised RNN-seq2seq model - f1 score: 0.6197
LDA, Stacked Denoising Autoencoder - f1 score: 0.7101
